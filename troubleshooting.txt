NOTE: Code is currently on Julia's personal Github. Could be worth cloning to Gittea
 
The code below hs beeen writen into a shell script in /home/juliam00/bin called rerun.sh   
It will rerun the schedule update with the most recent CyclotronSched.html file recieved
1) Delete all events on Google calendar if reruning due to a double addition of events 
2) run ./rerun.sh to readd events 

Code to run in shell (local on my Mac):
cd Desktop
mv CyclotronSched.html Work/Projects/GoogleCalendarUpdater/
cd Work/Projects/GoogleCalendarUpdater/
python3 update.py

Test run in mail.uwmcf.uw.edu:
move the html file you want to run with into /home/juliam00/schedules (you can move an archived schedule from /home/juliam00/jm/GoogleCalendarUpdater) 
rename the file to "CyclotronSched.html"
go to /home/juliam00/jm/bin
run updates.sh (./updates.sh)
otherwise updates.sh runs whenever an email with the correct subject is sent to my inbox

To clear out archived schedules from ~/GoogleCalendarUpdater, first ensure you are deleted only the files you want to by running:
find . -type f -name CyclotronSched.html.\*

then delete with:
find . -type f -name CyclotronSched.html.\* -exec rm {} \;
